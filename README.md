This is a sudoku game done using HTML, CSS and JS.

The main purpose is for self-improvement.

There are 3 difficulty levels: easy, medium, hard.

The way it is implemented is that it will generate the sudoku solution first, then hide the values on certain tiles (randomly generated) depending on the difficulty level, and will finally compare the user solution to the true solution.

If there are empty tiles during submission, user will be alerted to complete the puzzle first.

If the solutions do not match (i.e. the user-inputted values are wrong), user will be alerted to re-check their solution, but wil not be notified which tile is incorrectly inputted.

If the solutions match (i.e. the user-inputted values are correct), user will be alerted and there will be button to start a new game.

Throughout the game, user will be able to click on the Reset button which will clear the user-inputted fields.

There are currently no limit to the number of tries.

Sound effects are added for fun.
